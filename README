Scala & Play Framework playground

Very very similar to RubyOnRails but for Java (and Scala).  Here is my sample code to play around with play.

Steps to run:

1. Download PlayFramework: http://www.playframework.org/
2. Extract to desire location and put it on your path
3. Let Play install Scala module for you, from command line: "play install scala-0.9.1"
4. Clone this project (or download) and from command line: "play run"
5. Browse to http://localhost:9000 and enjoy.


4.1 To run unit test, start the test instead of regular run: "play test"
5.1 Browse to http://localhost:9000/@tests

Some thoughts:

1. Very much tied to "Anorm", SQL data access with Play.  Can we use others like Hibernate??
2. Scala Templates (http://scala.playframework.org/documentation/scala-0.9.1/templates) proprietary templating design
